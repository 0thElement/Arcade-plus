# Arcade-plus

Arcade is a utility used to edit and preview aff files. The original Arcade repository is DMCA takedowned (see [the DMCA takedown](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2019/02/2019-02-27-Arcaea.md)). The author of the original Arcade , [cnSchwarzer](https://github.com/cnSchwarzer) aka Sch, refused to remove copyright contents owned by Lowiro, the developer of the Arcaea. Sch use a Chinese code hosting platform after that instead.

This project, Arcade-plus will bring it back to GitHub. It will not contains copyright contents, but uses a skinning feature instead. Also we will have better commit messages and less bug. We will even adds some new features, get some redesign and do some performance optimization.

The original commit history of Sch will not be included in this repository, since they contains copyright contents.
